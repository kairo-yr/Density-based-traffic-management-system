# Density-Based Traffic Management System

This project aims to implement a density-based traffic management system using Python and Arduino. The system uses a camera to capture images of the four lanes of traffic, counts the number of vehicles in each lane, and adjusts the traffic lights accordingly. The system dynamically adjusts the light duration for each lane based on the traffic density to optimize traffic flow.

## Project Overview

### Components:
- **Camera**: Captures images of the 4 traffic lanes.
- **Python**: Used for image processing, vehicle detection, and counting vehicles in each lane.
- **Arduino**: Controls the LEDs (traffic lights) based on the data received from the Python script via the PySerial library.
- **LEDs**: Represent the traffic lights for each lane, which are controlled dynamically based on the vehicle count.

### Working Principle:
1. **Camera Capture**: A camera is placed in a position to capture the entire intersection, producing a single image.
2. **Image Processing**: The captured image is processed using Python, where the image is split into four sections (each representing a lane).
3. **Vehicle Detection and Counting**: The system uses image processing algorithms to detect and count the number of vehicles in each lane.
4. **Traffic Light Control**: Based on the vehicle count in each lane, the system adjusts the traffic light for that lane using an Arduino. The lane with the highest vehicle count is given priority for a longer green light duration.
5. **PySerial Communication**: The Python script communicates with the Arduino using the PySerial library to control the LEDs based on the vehicle count.

## Features:
- Vehicle detection in real-time using image processing.
- Dynamic traffic light control based on lane density.
- Efficient traffic management that adapts to real-time traffic conditions.
- Python-Arduino integration for controlling LEDs.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Used for image processing (OpenCV), vehicle counting, and controlling Arduino via PySerial.
- **Arduino**: Controls the LEDs based on the signals received from Python.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and vehicle detection.
- **PySerial**: Used to send signals from Python to Arduino to control the LEDs.
